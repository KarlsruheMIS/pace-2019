abstract="Crown structures in a graph are defined and shown to be useful in kernelization algorithms for the classic vertex cover problem. Two vertex cover kernelization methods are discussed. One, based on linear programming, has been in prior use and is known to produce predictable results, although it was not previously associated with crowns. The second, based on crown structures, is newer and much faster, but produces somewhat variable results. These two methods are studied and compared both theoretically and experimentally with each other and with older, more primitive kernelization algorithms. Properties of crowns and methods for identifying them are discussed. Logical connections between linear programming and crown reductions are established. It is shown that the problem of finding an induced crown-free subgraph, and the problem of finding a crown of maximum size in an arbitrary graph, are solvable in polynomial time.",

OPTabstract = { This paper explores techniques for solving the maximum clique and vertex coloring problems on very large-scale real-life networks. Because of the size of such networks and the intractability of the considered problems, previously developed exact algorithms may not be directly applicable. The proposed approaches aim to reduce the network instances to a size that is tractable for existing solvers, while preserving optimality. Two clique relaxation structures are exploited for this purpose. In addition to the known k-core structure, a newly introduced clique relaxation, k-community, is used to further reduce the instance size. Experimental results on real-life graphs (collaboration networks, P2P networks, social networks, etc.) show the proposed procedures to be effective by finding, for the first time, exact solutions for instances with over 18 million vertices. }

abstract="The maximum independent set problem is NP-hard and particularly difficult to solve in sparse graphs, which typically take exponential time to solve exactly using the best-known exact algorithms. In this paper, we present two new novel heuristic algorithms for computing large independent sets on huge sparse graphs, which are intractable in practice. First, we develop an advanced evolutionary algorithm that uses fast graph partitioning with local search algorithms to implement efficient combine operations that exchange whole blocks of given independent sets. Though the evolutionary algorithm itself is highly competitive with existing heuristic algorithms on large social networks, we further show that it can be effectively used as an oracle to guess vertices that are likely to be in large independent sets. We then show how to combine these guesses with kernelization techniques in a branch-and-reduce-like algorithm to compute high-quality independent sets quickly in huge complex networks. Our experiments against a recent (and fast) exact algorithm for large sparse graphs show that our technique always computes an optimal solution when the exact solution is known, and it further computes consistent results on even larger instances where the solution is unknown. Ultimately, we show that identifying and removing vertices likely to be in large independent sets opens up the reduction space---which not only speeds up the computation of large independent sets drastically, but also enables us to compute high-quality independent sets on much larger instances than previously reported in the literature.",

abstract = "This paper presents an O(1.2738k+kn)-time polynomial-space algorithm for Vertex Cover improving the previous O(1.286k+kn)-time polynomial-space upper bound by Chen, Kanj, and Jia. Most of the previous algorithms rely on exhaustive case-by-case branching rules, and an underlying conservative worst-case-scenario assumption. The contribution of the paper lies in the simplicity, uniformity, and obliviousness of the algorithm presented. Several new techniques, as well as generalizations of previous techniques, are introduced including: general folding, struction, tuples, and local amortized analysis. The algorithm also improves the O(1.2745kk4+kn)-time exponential-space upper bound for the problem by Chandran and Grandoni."

    abstract = {Author Summary Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are single base differences between individual genomes that lead to amino acid changes in protein sequences. They may influence an individual's susceptibility to disease or response to drugs through their impacts on a protein's structure and hence cause functional changes. In this paper, we present a new methodology to estimate the impact of nsSNPs on disease susceptibility. This is made possible by characterising the protein structure and the change of structural stability due to nsSNPs. We show that our computer program Bongo, which describes protein structures as interlinked amino acids, can identify conformational changes resulting from nsSNPs that are closely associated with pathological consequences. Bongo requires only structural information to analyze nsSNPs and thus is complementary to methods that use evolutionary information. Bongo helps us investigate the suggestion that most disease-causing mutations disturb structural features of proteins, thus affecting their stability. We anticipate that making Bongo available to the community will facilitate a better understanding of disease-associated nsSNPs and thus benefit personal medicine in the future.},
